# ✅ Script Updated: CAT1 Connections with Tunnel Support

## 🔄 What Changed

The population script has been updated to create a tunnel and configure the main connections to use it.

## 📦 New Structure

### Before (Old):
```
22 Connections (all standalone)
├── 16 main connections
└── 6 direct connections
```

### After (New):
```
1 Tunnel + 22 Connections
├── 🔒 CAT Legacy Env Tunnel
├── 16 main connections (→ via tunnel)
└── 6 direct connections (→ no tunnel)
```

## 🆕 What's New

### 1. Tunnel Created
- **Name:** CAT Legacy Env Tunnel
- **Group:** CAT1 Connection
- **Purpose:** Jump host/bastion for main connections
- **⚠️ Requires configuration** (host, username, password)

### 2. Main Connections Use Tunnel
All 16 main connections (host IP addresses) now have:
```javascript
tunnelId: "<tunnel-id>" // References CAT Legacy Env Tunnel
```

This means they will automatically connect through the tunnel!

### 3. Direct Connections Bypass Tunnel
The 6 "direct" connections (NATed IPs) have:
```javascript
tunnelId: undefined // No tunnel
```

They connect directly without going through the jump host.

## 🎯 Connection Flow

### Main Connections (via tunnel):
```
Your Computer
    ↓
CAT Legacy Env Tunnel (jump host)
    ↓
Target Server (e.g., Aurora DB1 @ 10.6.53.91)
```

### Direct Connections (no tunnel):
```
Your Computer
    ↓
Target Server (e.g., ptlc1s1ardb21 direct @ 10.93.1.190)
```

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Script
```
1. Open app (http://localhost:5173)
2. Press F12 → Console tab
3. Copy scripts/populate-cat1-data.js
4. Paste and press Enter
5. Press F5 to refresh
```

### Step 2: Configure the Tunnel ⚠️
```
1. Go to "Tunnels" tab in header
2. Expand "CAT1 Connection" group
3. Click pencil (✏️) on "CAT Legacy Env Tunnel"
4. Set:
   - Host: <your-jump-server-address>
   - Username: <your-username>
   - Password: <your-password>
5. Click "Save"
```

### Step 3: Set Connection Passwords
```
1. Go to "Connections" tab
2. Expand "CAT1 Connection" group
3. Edit each connection to add passwords
```

### Step 4: Test
```
1. Click play (▶️) on any main connection
2. It will automatically:
   - Connect to the tunnel first
   - Then connect to the target server through it
3. Click play (▶️) on any "direct" connection
   - It will connect directly (bypassing tunnel)
```

## 🔍 How to Verify

After running the script and refreshing:

### In Connections Tab:
```
📁 CAT1 Connection (22)
  ├── Aurora Ops Automation GUI     [via tunnel]
  ├── Aurora DB1                    [via tunnel]
  ├── ptlc1s1ardb21 direct          [direct]
  └── ... (19 more)
```

### In Tunnels Tab:
```
📁 CAT1 Connection (1)
  └── CAT Legacy Env Tunnel         [⚠️ Configure me!]
```

### In Console Output:
```
🚀 Starting CAT1 Connection Data Population...

✅ Created tunnel: "CAT Legacy Env Tunnel"
✅ SUCCESS!

📊 Added to the "CAT1 Connection" group:
   🔒 1 tunnel: "CAT Legacy Env Tunnel"
   🖥️  16 main connections (via tunnel)
   🔗 6 "direct" connections (no tunnel)
   📦 Total: 22 connections + 1 tunnel

🔄 Please refresh the page (F5) to see the new connections.

📝 Sample of connections added:
   • Aurora Ops Automation GUI (10.6.54.224) [via tunnel]
   • Aurora DB1 (10.6.53.91) [via tunnel]
   • ptlc1s1ardb21 direct (10.93.1.190) [direct]
   ... and 19 more

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Edit the tunnel to set the correct host, username, and password!
```

## 💡 Benefits

### 1. Security
- Centralized access through a single jump host
- No direct exposure of internal servers

### 2. Simplicity
- Configure tunnel once, use for all main connections
- Only one set of tunnel credentials to manage

### 3. Flexibility
- "Direct" connections available for servers accessible via NATed IPs
- Easy to switch between tunnel and direct access

### 4. Organization
- Everything grouped under "CAT1 Connection"
- Clear distinction between tunnel and direct connections

## ⚙️ Customization

You can edit the tunnel configuration in the script before running it:

```javascript
// In scripts/populate-cat1-data.js
const CAT_TUNNEL = {
  name: "CAT Legacy Env Tunnel",
  host: "",  // ← Set your jump host here
  port: 22,
  username: "root",  // ← Set your username here
  password: "",
  group: "CAT1 Connection"
};
```

If you set these values before running the script, you won't need to edit the tunnel afterward!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed" on main connections
→ Make sure the tunnel is configured correctly (host, username, password)

### "Direct" connections work, but main ones don't
→ Check tunnel configuration and credentials

### Want to add more connections to use the tunnel?
→ When creating a new connection, select "CAT Legacy Env Tunnel" from the tunnel dropdown

### Want to remove the tunnel from a connection?
→ Edit the connection and select "None" for tunnel

## 📚 Documentation Updated
