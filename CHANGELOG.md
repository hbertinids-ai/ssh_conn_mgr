# UI/UX Improvements - Change Log

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Settings Button
- Removed the "Settings" button from the header
- Simplified the UI to focus on Connections and Tunnels only
- Updated the view state type to only include 'connections' and 'tunnels'

### 2. ✅ Toggle Sidebar with Top-Left Icon
- Converted the top-left icon from static to an interactive button
- **Click the icon** to show/hide the left sidebar
- Visual feedback with icon change:
  - `PanelLeftClose` icon when sidebar is visible
  - `PanelLeft` icon when sidebar is hidden
- Smooth transition with hover effects
- Added helpful tooltip on hover

### 3. ✅ Multiple Tabs for Same Connection - **FIXED!**
- **Issue identified and resolved!** The previous implementation was disposing terminals on tab switch
- **Root cause:** Each render was creating/disposing the terminal for the active session only
- **Solution:** Completely rewrote the Terminal component to:
  - Maintain separate terminal instances for ALL active sessions
  - Only show/hide terminals instead of creating/destroying them
  - Use a Map to track terminal instances by session ID
  - Properly manage SSH connections for each session independently
- **How to use:**
  1. Click the Play button (▶️) on any connection
  2. A new tab opens
  3. Click the Play button again on the same connection
  4. Another independent tab opens for that connection
  5. Both tabs remain active - switch between them freely!
  6. Each tab maintains its own terminal state and SSH connection

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component
  - Added `sidebarVisible` state
  - Removed Settings button and view
  - Made sidebar conditionally render based on state
  - Connected toggle button to sidebar visibility

### Benefits
1. **Cleaner UI** - Less clutter without the unused Settings button
2. **More screen space** - Toggle sidebar when you need more terminal space
3. **Multiple sessions** - Open multiple tabs to the same server (e.g., different directories)
4. **Better UX** - Clear visual feedback for sidebar state

## How to Use

### Toggle Sidebar
- Click the colorful icon in the top-left corner
- Icon changes to indicate current state
- Sidebar slides in/out smoothly

### Open Multiple Tabs to Same Connection
1. Go to Connections view
2. Click Play (▶️) on a connection → Tab 1 opens
3. Click Play (▶️) on the same connection again → Tab 2 opens
4. Repeat as needed!
5. Each tab is independent with its own terminal session

### Example Use Cases for Multiple Tabs
- Monitor logs in one tab, edit files in another
- Run a long process in one tab, work in another
- Multiple directories on the same server
- Separate sessions for different tasks

## Bug Fixes

### Multiple Tabs Issue
- **Problem:** Opening multiple tabs caused the first tab to close
- **Console Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dimensions')`
- **Root Cause:** Terminal instances were being disposed on every tab switch
- **Solution:** Rewrote Terminal component with proper multi-instance management

## Testing
✅ Build successful
✅ All components updated
✅ TypeScript errors resolved
✅ Multiple terminal instances working correctly
✅ No more dimension errors
✅ Ready to use with `npm run dev`
