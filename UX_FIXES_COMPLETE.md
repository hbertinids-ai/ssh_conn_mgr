# ✅ UI/UX Fixes - Complete!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Double Character Echo Fixed
**Problem:** When typing in the terminal, characters were appearing twice (e.g., typing "ls" showed "llss")

**Root Cause:** The `term.onData()` event was being registered twice - once for capturing output to save, and once for sending data to SSH.

**Solution:**
- Removed the duplicate `term.onData()` registration
- Consolidated into a single handler that:
  1. Captures data for the output buffer (for saving)
  2. Sends data to SSH via IPC

**Changed File:** `src/components/Terminal.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// First registration (for saving)
term.onData((data) => {
  outputBuffer.push(data);
});

// Second registration (for SSH)
term.onData((data) => {
  window.electron.ssh.write(session.id, data);
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Single registration - does both
term.onData((data) => {
  outputBuffer.push(data);
  window.electron.ssh.write(session.id, data);
});
```

### 2. ✅ Auto-Focus Terminal on Connection
**Problem:** When opening a new SSH connection, the terminal didn't automatically receive keyboard focus, requiring users to click on the terminal area before typing.

**Solution:**
- Added `term.focus()` call when a session becomes active
- Focus is set automatically after the terminal is shown and resized

**Changed File:** `src/components/Terminal.tsx`

**Code:**
```typescript
// Show/hide terminals based on active session
terminalsRef.current.forEach((instance, id) => {
  instance.element.style.display = id === activeSessionId ? 'block' : 'none';
  if (id === activeSessionId) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      instance.fitAddon.fit();
      instance.term.focus(); // ← Auto-focus added here
    }, 0);
  }
});
```

**User Experience:**
- Click play (▶️) to connect
- Terminal opens AND is immediately ready for typing
- No need to click on the terminal first

### 3. ✅ Label Wrapping in Connection/Tunnel Cards
**Problem:** Long connection or tunnel names would overlap with the action icons (play, edit, delete buttons) on the right side of the card.

**Solution:**
- Changed layout to use proper flexbox spacing with `gap-2`
- Made labels use `break-words` instead of `truncate`
- Added `min-w-0` to allow flex item to shrink
- Made icons `flex-shrink-0` so they never compress
- Adjusted icon alignment with `mt-1` to align with multi-line text

**Changed Files:** 
- `src/components/ConnectionManager.tsx`
- `src/components/TunnelManager.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
<div className="flex items-start justify-between mb-2">
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 flex-1">
    <div className="w-3 h-3 rounded-full" />
    <h3 className="font-medium text-white truncate">{name}</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="flex space-x-1 ...">
    {/* buttons */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<div className="flex items-start justify-between mb-2 gap-2">
  <div className="flex items-start space-x-2 flex-1 min-w-0">
    <div className="w-3 h-3 rounded-full flex-shrink-0 mt-1" />
    <h3 className="font-medium text-white break-words">{name}</h3>
  </div>
  <div className="flex space-x-1 ... flex-shrink-0">
    {/* buttons */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Key Changes:**
- `gap-2` - Adds consistent spacing between label and buttons
- `items-start` - Aligns items to top for multi-line text
- `min-w-0` - Allows text container to shrink properly
- `break-words` - Wraps long text instead of truncating
- `flex-shrink-0` - Prevents buttons from compressing
- `mt-1` - Aligns icon with first line of text

**Visual Result:**
```
Before (overlapping):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔵 Very Long Connection Na... ▶✏🗑│  ← Overlaps!
└─────────────────────────────────┘

After (wrapped):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔵 Very Long Connection      ▶✏🗑│
│    Name That Wraps              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: Double Echo Fixed
- [ ] Open an SSH connection
- [ ] Type commands: `ls`, `pwd`, `echo test`
- [ ] Verify characters appear only once
- [ ] Check both with and without tunnel connections

### ✅ Test 2: Auto-Focus
- [ ] Click play (▶️) on any connection
- [ ] Terminal should open
- [ ] Immediately start typing without clicking
- [ ] Characters should appear in the terminal
- [ ] Test switching between multiple tabs

### ✅ Test 3: Label Wrapping
- [ ] Create a connection with a very long name (50+ characters)
- [ ] View the connection card in the sidebar
- [ ] Verify the name wraps to multiple lines
- [ ] Verify action icons (▶✏🗑) remain visible and don't overlap
- [ ] Hover to see icons - they should be perfectly aligned
- [ ] Test with both connections and tunnels
