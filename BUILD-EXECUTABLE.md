# Windows Executable Build Guide

## ✅ Successfully Created Windows Executable

The SSH Connection Manager has been successfully packaged as a Windows executable!

## 📁 Executable Location
```
.\release\ssh-connection-manager-win32-x64\ssh-connection-manager.exe
```

## 🚀 How to Build

### Option 1: Using npm script
```bash
npm run build:exe

```

### Option 3: Manual steps

## 📦 What Gets Created

The build process creates a complete standalone application in the `release/ssh-connection-manager-win32-x64/` directory containing:

- `ssh-connection-manager.exe` - Main executable
- All required DLLs and dependencies
- Resources and assets
- No installation required - just run the .exe file

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Executable

1. Navigate to: `.\release\ssh-connection-manager-win32-x64\`
2. Double-click `ssh-connection-manager.exe` or run from command line
3. The application will start without requiring installation

## ⚠️ Note About Antivirus

Since the executable is not code-signed, some antivirus software may flag it as suspicious. This is normal for unsigned Electron applications. You may need to:
- Add an exception to your antivirus software
- Click "More info" -> "Run anyway" if Windows Defender shows a warning
